### What is an Enum

Enums are short for "enumeration," and is a data type that consists of a set of named values "enumerators" or "constants", that represent various options or states.

In our example the "enumerations" of our enumerated object called "directions" will represent various directions:

```typescript
enum Direction {
  North = 'North',
  South = 'South',
  East = 'East',
  West = 'West'
}
```
